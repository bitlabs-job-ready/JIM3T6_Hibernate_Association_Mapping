
In Hibernate, you can use the @OneToOne annotation to map a one-to-one relationship between two Java objects.

Here is an example of how you could map a one-to-one relationship between a "Person" class and an "Address" class, where a person has one address:

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.OneToOne;

@Entity
public class Person {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;

    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;

    @OneToOne
    private Address address;

    // Getters and setters for the fields
}

@Entity
public class Address {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;

    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String state;
    private String zipCode;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "address")
    private Person person;

    // Getters and setters for the fields
}

To create and persist these objects and their relationship in the database, you can use the following steps:

Create a Hibernate session factory and open a Hibernate session.

Create a new Person object and a new Address object.

Set the Address object's person field to the Person object.

Set the Person object's address field to the Address object.

Use the session's save() method to persist the Person and Address objects to the database.

Close the session.
